# Tawsela-2018
Twsela is a free backend node.js transportation service like Uber/careem.
It is a real-time, instant mobile application to facilitate transportation. 
like Uber/Careem we have used the latest technologies to serve more clients and scale so fast in an instant manner. 
Unlike Uber/Careem the service is totally free and mainly developed to target Taxi drivers. 
We were aiming to implement as many concepts of software engineering and get more experience with open source projects.
The project was divided into three mainly parts, The BackEnd which is the core and logic behind great application implemented 
by latest web technologies, 2 Mobile applications one for passenger and another for Driver which was professional developed using 
latest android libraries, Web Interface for user to register, view their history and many more. We were always keen to learn more 
and implement the latest technologies in a professional way. We have enjoyed so much working on such a great project and seeing 
How things really worked. It turns out that things you struggled with became the best choice ever happened and although we knew 
other technologies we insisted to learn and grow with latest interesting ones.
Eventually we ask for more guidance|feedback to improve our programming skills, if any.
